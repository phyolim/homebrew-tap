  caveats <<~EOS
    On first launch the app asks whether this Mac is the Hub or a Worker.
    Picking Hub finishes setup by itself: it sets a dashboard password (shown
    once + copied to the clipboard) and starts the daemon — a real LAN hub with
    auth on. Forgot the password? `outerloop status` shows it.
    State stays in ~/Library/Application Support/outerloop and is NOT removed on
    uninstall or zap.
